Frogger Game:

When the project loads, a simple character-selection game menu screen will appear. Click on whichever character you'd like to be and the game screen will come up.

The goal is to get to the water without getting hit by a bug (or eventually a lawn mower or an obstacle). With each level, an obstacle is added. Once you hit level four, a lawn mower is added. Players can move left, right, up, and down one tile at a time with the respective arrow keys.

After level 5, you get a new life. New lives are displayed as character graphics in the lower right-hand corner. When you run out of lives, a Game Over screen with the option to start over appears.

If you get to level 10, you get a prize and a "Winner's Screen" appears.s
